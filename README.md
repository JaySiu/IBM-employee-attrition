Employees have always been important assets of firms as they create values for the firms and are an integral part of the companiesâ€™ business operation, exemplified by the setting up of human resource department in almost every big firm. Employee attrition would trigger detrimental consequences toward the firms because of the attrition costs, encompassing training cost of new employees, administration cost, etc. It is, therefore, conceivably conducive to curb high attrition rate by predicting potential attrition among the current employees, and thus befitting measures can accordingly be taken. In light of this problem, we would like to analyze the IBM HR Employee dataset, create prediction models upon it, and compare different data preparation and hyperparameter tuning ways. The goal is to generate a prediction model that can accurately predict employee attrition so as to avoid the above- mentioned problems and is to create a reference for how to build and evaluate prediction models for other employee attrition situations.
